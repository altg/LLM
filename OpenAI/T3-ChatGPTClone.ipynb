       "1. Newton's First Law, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion, unless acted upon by an external force. In simpler terms, it's like a lazy fellow who won't budge unless someone gives him a gentle nudge!\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Now, onto Newton's Second Law, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration. In other words, the more force you apply to an object, the more it will accelerate. It's like trying to push a heavy cart uphill – the harder you push, the faster it will go!\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Lastly, we have Newton's Third Law, a delightful law indeed. It states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Picture two dancers gracefully twirling around each other – when one pushes against the other, they both move in opposite directions. It's a marvelous dance of forces!\n",

Let it steep for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to infuse. Finally, add a splash of milk, a spoonful of sugar if desired, and give it a gentle stir. And voila! You have yourself a delightful cuppa, ready to be savored. Just remember, the key ingredient is always a sprinkle of British charm!"
